# Welcome to Mini Company Lab 

You are a collaborator (developer), not the owner.
Rule: Do NOT push directly to `main`. Use a branch + Pull Request (PR).

## What you must do first
1) Clone the repo to your laptop
2) Create your own branch (yourname-task)
3) Complete your assigned GitHub Issue
4) Open a Pull Request (PR) and request review from the owner

## Your tasks
- Developer 1 (luqmansean1): See Issue #1
- Developer 2 (luqmanqazi961-beep): See Issue #2

## How to name your branch
- dev1: `luqmansean1-task`
- dev2: `luqmanqazi961-beep-task`

## How to run tests
Later we will run:
- `python --version`
- `pip install pytest`
- `pytest -q`
